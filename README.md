Data scientist who enjoys programming in R, data visualisation, graph theory and combinatorics.

Here are a few of my R projects:

- [funcgeo](https://github.com/MHenderson/funcgeo) - functional geometry in R.

- [mhall-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/mhall-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Marshall Hall's theorem.

- [ryser-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/ryser-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Ryser's theorem.

I am working on a [monograph](https://github.com/MHenderson/room) about [Room Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_square).

Here are a few other projects related to Room squares.

- [maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/maximal-room-squares) - generate maximal partial Room squares in R.

- [room-square-generator](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-square-generator) - a Java application for generating Room squares.

- [room-squares-bib](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-squares-bib) - a bibliography of Room squares.

For my data visualisation work please look at the [tidy-tuesday](https://github.com/MHenderson/tidy-tuesday) repository which collects all of my efforts towards the weekly [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.
