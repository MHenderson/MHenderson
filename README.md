R and Python developer who is mostly interested in graph theory and combinatorics.

In 2024 I am writing a [monograph](https://github.com/MHenderson/room) about [Room Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_square).

Here are a few other projects of mine involving Room squares:

- [maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/maximal-room-squares) - generate maximal partial Room squares in R.

- [more-maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/more-maximal-room-squares) - R6-based implementation of maximal partial Room squares.

- [room-square-generator](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-square-generator) - Java application for generating Room squares.

- [room-squares-bib](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-squares-bib) - a bibliography of Room squares.

- [room-squares-animation](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-squares-animation) - animate sequences of partial Room squares.

I am also working on an R package ([{keedwell}](https://github.com/MHenderson/keedwell)) for completion and embedding problems for latin squares.

The usage of {keedwell} is demonstrated in the following two repositories:

- [mhall-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/mhall-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Marshall Hall's theorem.

- [ryser-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/ryser-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Ryser's theorem.

I have also been working on two Python packages for list-colourings of graphs:

- [{vizing}](https://github.com/MHenderson/vizing) - constraint-based list-colouring in Python.

- [{listcolouring}](https://github.com/MHenderson/listcolouring) - list colouring in Python with NetworkX.

I have dabbled in data visualisation. Please see the [tidy-tuesday](https://github.com/MHenderson/tidy-tuesday) repository which collects all of my efforts towards the weekly [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.

I am also interested in functional programming and have created an R package for functional geometry.

- [{funcgeo}](https://github.com/MHenderson/funcgeo) - functional geometry in R.

- [squarelimit](https://github.com/MHenderson/squarelimit) - recreate Escher's [*Square Limit*](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.135604.html) with {funcgeo}.
