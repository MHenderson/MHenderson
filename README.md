## Room Squares

I am writing a [book](https://github.com/MHenderson/room) about [Room Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_square).

I am also developing an R package [{wallis}](https://github.com/MHenderson/wallis) for constructing examples of Room squares.

Usage of {wallis} is demonstrated in these repositories:

- [maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/maximal-room-squares) - generate maximal partial Room squares in R.
- [room-squares-animation](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-squares-animation) - animate sequences of partial Room squares.

## Latin Squares

I am developing an R package [{keedwell}](https://github.com/MHenderson/keedwell) for completing and embedding (partial) latin squares/rectangles.

Usage of {keedwell} is demonstrated in these repositories:

- [mhall-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/mhall-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Marshall Hall's theorem.
- [ryser-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/ryser-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Ryser's theorem.
