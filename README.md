I am a data scientist who enjoys programming in R, data visualisation, graph theory and combinatorics.

Here are a few of my R projects:

- [minion-r/rminion](https://github.com/minion-r/rminion) - call the Minion constraint solver from R

- [funcgeo](https://github.com/MHenderson/funcgeo) - functional geometry in R.

- [mhall-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/mhall-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Marshall Hall's theorem.

- [todotxt](https://github.com/MHenderson/todotxt) - parse todo.txt files in R.

- [mhall-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/mhall-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Ryser's theorem.

- [MHenderson/maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/maximal-room-squares) - generate maximal partial Room squares in R.

For my data visualisation work please look at the [tidy-tuesday](https://github.com/MHenderson/tidy-tuesday) repository which collects all of my efforts towards the weekly Tidy Tuesday project.
