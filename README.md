Data scientist who enjoys programming in R, data visualisation, graph theory and combinatorics.

Here are a few of my R projects:

- [funcgeo](https://github.com/MHenderson/funcgeo) - functional geometry in R.

- [mhall-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/mhall-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Marshall Hall's theorem.

- [ryser-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/ryser-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Ryser's theorem.

- [maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/maximal-room-squares) - generate maximal partial Room squares in R.

For my data visualisation work please look at the [tidy-tuesday](https://github.com/MHenderson/tidy-tuesday) repository which collects all of my efforts towards the weekly Tidy Tuesday project.

I am working on a [monograph](https://github.com/MHenderson/room) about [Room Squares]([Room square - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_square)).
