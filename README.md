## Room Squares

I am writing a [monograph](https://github.com/MHenderson/room) about [Room Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_square).

Room square related projects of mine:

- [maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/maximal-room-squares) - generate maximal partial Room squares in R.

- [more-maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/more-maximal-room-squares) - an R6-based implementation of maximal partial Room squares.

- [room-square-generator](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-square-generator) - a Java application for generating Room squares.

- [room-squares-bib](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-squares-bib) - a bibliography of Room squares.

- [room-squares-animation](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-squares-animation) - animate sequences of partial Room squares.

## Latin Squares

I am also working on an R package [{keedwell}](https://github.com/MHenderson/keedwell) about completion and embedding problems for latin squares.

Use of {keedwell} is demonstrated by these two repositories:

- [mhall-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/mhall-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Marshall Hall's theorem.

- [ryser-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/ryser-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Ryser's theorem.
