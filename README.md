## Combinatorics

I am writing a [book](https://github.com/MHenderson/room) and a [bibliography](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-squares-bib) about [Room Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_square).

I am also developing an R package [{wallis}](https://github.com/MHenderson/wallis) for constructing examples of Room squares.

{wallis} is demonstrated in these repositories:

- [maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/maximal-room-squares) - generate maximal partial Room squares in R.
- [more-maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/more-maximal-room-squares) - an R6-based implementation of maximal partial Room squares in R.
- [greedy-maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/greedy-maximal-room-squares) - exploring the spectra of maximal partial Room squares in R using the wallis package.
- [random-maximal-room-squares](https://github.com/MHenderson/random-maximal-room-squares) - randomised maximal partial Room squares in R with wallis.
- [room-squares-animation](https://github.com/MHenderson/room-squares-animation) - animate sequences of partial Room squares.

I am also developing an R package [{keedwell}](https://github.com/MHenderson/keedwell) for completing and embedding (partial) latin squares/rectangles.

{keedwell} is demonstrated in these repositories:

- [mhall-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/mhall-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Marshall Hall's theorem.
- [ryser-in-r](https://github.com/MHenderson/ryser-in-r) - extending latin rectangles in R using Ryser's theorem.

I am also developing a Python package [{ryser}](https://github.com/MHenderson/ryser) for modelling completion and embedding of partial latin squares and rectangles as list-colouring problems.

{ryser} is demonstrated in this repository:
- [completing-pls](https://github.com/MHenderson/completing-pls) - completing partial latin squares in Python with ryser.

## Graph Theory

I am developing Python packages [{listcolouring}](https://github.com/MHenderson/listcolouring) for list-colourings of graphs and [{vizing}](https://github.com/MHenderson/vizing) for list-colouring via constraint modelling.

{listcolouring} is demonstrated in this repository:
- [greedy-list-colouring](https://github.com/MHenderson/greedy-list-colouring) - greedy list and greedy list-edge colouring in Python with the listcolouring package.

{vizing} is demonstrated in this repository:
- [constraint-list-colouring](https://github.com/MHenderson/constraint-list-colouring) - constraint-based list-colouring in Python with vizing.
